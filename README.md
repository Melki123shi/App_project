# A brief description about our project

Our project is a simple management system for car shops. This app enables shop owner to easily control their business.

The admin (in our case the owner of the car sales) with roles:
*	Logging in to the system
* Registering, removing and updating employees’ information 
*	Registering cars ,and removing them when sold

Employee user with roles:

*	Sign up to the system inputting their information and unique code generated when the admin registers them
*	Logging into the system 
*	view list of car to be sold with their respective information
*	mark as ‘sold’ when a car is sold


Once the employee has signed up the employee can view list of car to be sold with their respective information. The employee can then use that information to sell products to customers (The employee can also make the customer to choose cars before proceeding to show the actual car for the customer to buy). Once the product has been sold the employee can touch sold and the system marks the product as sold by the employee who sold the car to the customer. This can be handy when the admin wants to promote or give acknowledgement for their best employees. And also have a full information about and full control over their shop.

To sum up so what does our project provides:
1. It calculates profit for a single car as well as the whole sell in every month and every year
2. It enables the admin to register employees.
3. It enables the admin to easily control the employee sells. 
4. It provides full sells information for the admin about their shop.
